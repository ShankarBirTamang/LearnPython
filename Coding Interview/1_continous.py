#  You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can replace any
# element in nums with any integer.

# nums is considered continous if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:

# All elements in nums are unique.
# The difference between the max element and min element in nums = nums.length - 1
# For eg: nums = [4,2, 5,3] is continuous , but nums = [1,2,3,5,6] is not continuous.

# Return the minimum number of operations to make nums continuous.
